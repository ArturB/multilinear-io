[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ArturB/Multilinear.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ArturB/Multilinear)

Multilinear is general - purpose linear algebra and multi-dimensional array library for Haskell. It provides generic and efficient implementation of linear algebra operations on vectors, linear functionals, matrices and its higher - rank analoges: tensors. It can also be used as simply a miltidimensional arrays for everyone. 

### AS FOR NOW, THE LIBRARY IS IN PRODUCTION PHASE  - DO NOT USE IT FOR PRODUCTION!! ###

## Scripting ##

Multilinear is optimized to being used from GHCi. It uses easy and concise notation of Einstein summation convention to calculate complex tasks. Using this, you are able to write for example a deep learnin neural network from scratch in just a few lines of interpreter code. If you want to know more about Einstein convention, see the Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation

## Machine learning ##

Multi-dimensional algebra is especially useful to quickly write machine learning algorithms (eg. neural networks) from scratch. When library will be stable, some examples will be available. 

### Installation ###

Installation using Stack. Invoke this command in library folder:

```
stack build
```
